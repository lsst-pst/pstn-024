\section{Introduction}

Introduce the data products, pipelines and science platform and the catalogues

\section{LSST Science Requirements}
 
 Summary of the relevant LSST science requirements 
 
\section{Verification and Validation Datasets} 

Here we describe the test datasets: \cite{DMTN-091}

\section{Tooling  and Framework} 

Reference some of the  tooling used  for QA  from Square \cite{pstn-023} and how this is used to do QA, e.g SQuaSH, lsst.verify. 

\subsection{ap\_verify} 

\subsection{validate\_drp}

\subsection{ DRP pipe\_analysis}

\subsection{data explorer}

\section{Tests of LSST Data Products } 

\subsection{Calibration tests }

\subsection{Photometry tests }

\subsection{Astrometry tests }

 .. and many more sections


 \section{Meeting the 10-yr science goals} 
 What does the science verification and validation say about the prospects for meeting the 10-year survey science goals. How is the performance expected to improve over the successive data releases? 
 \section{Summary and discussion}
